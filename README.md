Welcome to the FORCE website!

This website was created as part of a web development contest conducted by the FORCE Club within our institute. I am pleased to announce that I came in first place in the contest, and I am excited to share my project with you.

The FORCE website is a technical club website designed to provide information about the club and its activities, as well as resources for members and interested parties. The website includes the following features:

A home page that provides an overview of the club and its mission
A calendar page that lists upcoming events and meetings
A resources page that includes links to helpful resources for members, such as tutorials and study materials
A contact page that provides information on how to get in touch with the club
To build the FORCE website, I used the following technologies:

HTML for the structure and content of the website
CSS for styling and layout
JavaScript for interactivity and dynamic content

I hope you find the FORCE website useful and informative. If you have any questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to contact us through the website or on our social media channels.

Thank you for visiting!
